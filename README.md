# Fingerprint-Based-Biometric-Voting-System-Using-Arduino
The Fingerprint-Based Biometric Voting System uses Arduino for secure voting. Voters register fingerprints, stored with unique IDs. During voting, the system verifies the voterâ€™s fingerprint, ensuring no duplicates. Voters select from three candidates, and results are shown on the LCD display, with LEDs and a buzzer for feedback.
